# GameDesignProject
A game that my group of three made in our 3D game design class. Created in unity, we used C# scripts, Unity's built-in terrain builder, and free assets on the unity store, as well as a few simple assets made by another group member.

To be clear, I am NOT the sole contributer to this project. One other group member and I wrote and collaborated on most of the scripts, while the third member focused mostly on graphics.

As a general summary, the game is a wave-based zombie survival in which you must defend 4 generators as well as preserving your own health. There is a brief time in between rounds during which you can spend money in a shop to upgrade and refill ammo capacity, heal yourself, and repair generators. You lose when either you lose all of your health or all generators are destroyed. There is no win condition, there are only endless waves.

In this repository are the scripts used in the game ONLY. No other assets have been imported.
